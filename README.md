# Emergent Communication Using RLlib

This repository provide a basic framework for training agents to communicate using [RLlib](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html).
The agents communicate via a differentiable channel that allows us to backpropagate through the communication channel. Thereby, the parameters of
the sender agent can be optimised to maximise the reward generated by the receiver agent's actions in the environment.
